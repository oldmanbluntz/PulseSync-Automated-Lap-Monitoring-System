# Slot-Car-Lap-Counter
Just a timer system for slot car tracks. Based around the ESP32, has a web portal that displays the data, as well as on screens on the track.

The Web Portal is currently not tested.

I have other plans to add to this. MicroSD card support to save track and driver data, choices for multiple types of LCD or OLED screen for the physical track,
choices to choose how many lanes, and a few other options.

If you would like to see the wiring layout, and see how it operates with just simple buttons, check out the build on Wokwi I have made
